Airfeed (previously called Kipper) is an anonymous location based chat app, like the late app Yik Yak but with some added features. 

Users can find parties as well as post, comment, and vote on other users' content anonymously. Find the Android version on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.artfara.apps.kipper).
